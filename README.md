## LED controller application
### Use cases:
- Control LED's based on screen capture
- Control LED's manually.
- Debug while testing.
### What it is not:
- A full fletched LED controller that works for all LED strips
- A plug and play application. You will have to manually select your port every time.
### Planned features:
- More flexible use to work for more use cases.
- Single LED adressing.
- Optimize code to send data thats more customizable and less resource intensive.
- Improve Arduino code.
